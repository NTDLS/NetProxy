# NetProxy
Turn your machine into a TCP/IP load-balancing, tunneling, router and shape traffic with ease. Simple, clean, fast and secure!

NetProxy is the newer .NET rendition of the C++ NetRouter (https://github.com/NTDLS/NetRouter). They provide the same functionality, so let us know if you need changes to one or the other.

👀 If you like NetProxy, you may also be interested in [NetTunnel](https://github.com/NTDLS/NetTunnel), it has a lot of the same functionality with some extra flexibility. Just check it out.

This application runs as a Windows Service and allows you to redirect TCP/IP traffic to a host or IP address of your choosing. Unlike some dedicated hardware devices, you’ll find that load-balancing and/or fail-over configurations are easy to setup – but you’ll also find some of the more advanced options such as session persistence, buffering and even in-flight HTTP header manipulation.

As always, the service is high performance, secure, and can be remotely administered through an easy to use management interface.

If you require similar routing but through firewalls where you have no control, then be sure to check out https://github.com/NTDLS/NetTunnel
